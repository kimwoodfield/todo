# todoüìù

A todo list built with vanilla JavaScript

Things I want to add:
- At the moment, editing a todo relies on the ``window.prompt()`` method. Ideally, users can click the text which generates an text input that updates the original text
- Changes to the checkbox, edit and delete buttons. At the moment they still rely too heavily on default styling
- Look at implementing local storage so that todos can be saved when the app is run locally
