# todo📝

A todo list built with vanilla JavaScript

Things I want to add:
- At the moment, editing a todo relies on the ``window.prompt()`` method. Ideally, users can click the text which generates an text input that updates the original text
- Look at implementing local storage so that todos can be saved when the app is run locally
- Include a 'completed todos' list independent from the current todo list
- ~~Adjust styling on add, edit and delete buttons as they are currently too reliant on default styling
